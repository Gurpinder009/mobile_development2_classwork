# Get Healthy App
This application is compilable or runnable but it is not complete. There are many features that are required implementation and some of them requires refinement and i am working on it.

## List of features implemented so far
 - map locator (require permission handler)
 - authentication (require better error message)
 - Dashboard (requires cloud data and little more styling)
 - cloud setup complete
 - project structure well and good.

## Remaining
 - location permission handler (reading docs)
 - authentication messages 
 - Dashboard (data ready at cloud make modelDBHelper)
 - Report page (recyclerView ready requires visual design)

## How to run
 - compile this application
 - close and manually grant location permission
 - Manually create user or use mine
    - email "singh@gmail.com"
    - password "Password@123"
